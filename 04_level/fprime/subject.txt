--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a positive int and displays its prime factors on the
standard output, followed by a newline.

Factors must be displayed in ascending order and separated by '*', so that
the expression in the output gives the right result.

If the number of parameters is not 1, simply display a newline.

The input, when there is one, will be valid.
